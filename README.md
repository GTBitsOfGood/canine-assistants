## Onboarding

### MongoDB

Install¬†[MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/)¬†to host a local instance of MongoDB. It may also be helpful to download¬†[MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass#compass)¬†to view the state of your database.

### Dependencies

Make sure you have [Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. Check by running `node -v`. If your Node version is less than 18, either reinstall Node from the prior link or manage _multiple_ versions of Node with a tool like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

In the root directory of the project, run:

```sh
npm install
```

This command should have installed all necessary dependencies for the app to run.

### Environment Variables

In the root directory, run one of these commands based on your OS:

```sh
npm run secrets:linux # mac / linux
npm run secrets:windows # windows
```

You should be prompted for a master password. Ask your Engineering leadership to continue. Once the password has been verified, your¬†`.env.development.local`¬†file should have been created automatically for you.

### Development

To start the Next.js dev server, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Code Formatting

Install and enable¬†[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)¬†in VSCode. This repository is also configured with a pre-commit hook that automatically formats any code you commit to ensure formatting consistency throughout the codebase.
